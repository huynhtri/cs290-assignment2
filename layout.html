			<p>
				My name is Solomon and I got a BS in Accountancy at Northern Arizona University. I currently live in Phoenix, AZ working as an accountant. 
				The job entails accounting for all health insurance related matters for employees, retirees, and people on COBRA as well as tracking all 
				construction in progress. I decided to major in CS after working on Visual Basic macros on excel while working for the State. I find myself 
				enjoying programming macros or small projects to increase efficiency rather than being an accountant because accounting gets boring doing 
				the same daily, monthly, and yearly work year after year. I could not see myself doing that for the next 10-20 years so I decided to do 
				something that is continuously changing and challenging to do.
			</p>
			<p> 
				One interesting fact is I got married about 6 months ago.Besides that, I enjoy playing video games (usually competitive or role-playing games) 
				and playing the piano. I actually majored in piano for undergrad but I suffered from tendonitis from playing the piano for too long so I was 
				forced to change majors at that point. I still play piano part time for choirs and occasionally learn classical pieces to perform with friends.
